# ML Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of core **Machine Learning algorithms from scratch** using **Python and NumPy** to understand how code works behind sklearn library.
The goal of this project is to understand the **mathematics, logic, and workflow** behind commonly used ML algorithms.

## 📌 Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression
- Implemented using the **Gradient Descent**
- Predicts continuous values
- Evaluated using R² score

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Binary classification (0 / 1)
- Uses **sigmoid function**
- Probability-based classification
- Evaluated using accuracy

### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Distance-based (lazy learning) algorithm
- Uses **Euclidean distance**
- Majority voting for classification

## 📊 Dataset
- Small synthetic datasets created manually
- 2D feature space for better visualization and understanding
- Separate sample files for each algorithm

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## How to Run 

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sonakshigupta29/ML_Algorithm_Scratch_Implementation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd ML_Algorithm_Scratch_Implementation
3. Open Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
4. Run any *_main.ipynb file to see the implementation and results.

## Future Improvements

- Add algorithms such as **Softmax Regression**, **Polynomial Regression**, and **Neural Networks** as I continue learning.
- Introduce model optimizations like **train–test split**, **better evaluation metrics**, **performance analysis** and etc to gain insight into how machine learning algorithms work behind the scenes.
